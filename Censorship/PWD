These videos are mostly using H265 codecs, which means that they cannot be played by default video players 
in devices like smart TV's or cellphones. For those you can use VLC which supports H265. 
Whatsapp and Telegram cannot play these videos, they can be shared but the recipent has to have VLC on their phone to see it, 
and they have to be played "manually" (meaning execute it from the file explorer).

Why using H265 codecs?
Because they are %50 more efficient. Just install VLC player, which is free and open source.
