# This list is a FAS "Frequently Asked Sites".

### 1- Spotify has ads, how to remove them?

    Use https://github.com/SpotX-CLI/ for PC use.  -No, you won't get premium quality sound (no 320kbps).

    Use https://xmanagerapp.com/ for android use.  -No, you won't get premium quality sound (no 320kbps).

### 2- Vanced doesn't work anymore, alternatives?

    Use https://f-droid.org/packages/free.rm.skytube.oss/    -for android.
    Use https://github.com/revanced/                         -for android.

### 3- Where do I download clean games?

       
    https://cs.rin.ru/                     -clean steam files, must apply steam emu; latest downloads/versions and obscure steam games available

    https://www.game-repack.site

    http://dodi-repacks.site/

    https://gog-games.to/   -or-  ONION (tor browser) http://goggamespyi7b6ybpnpnlwhb4md6owgbijfsuj6z5hesqt3yfyz42rad.onion/     -Very nice GOG games catalog.
    
    https://steamrip.com/     -Steam games pre-cracked and pre-installed. Its basically doing a "repack" of games from cs.rin.ru by applying the steam emu to them.

    https://fitgirl-repacks.site/     -from the top to the bottom of the pit; fitgirl repacks are now mostly indie osbcure and dumb games. You 'may' find some AAA titles but don't expect to be so lucky all the time. Better use cs.rin.ru.

__WARNING:__ I've seen a claim made by FitGirl or "her staff" [telling others to NOT USE AN ANTIVIRUS](https://fitgirl-repacks.site/tiny-tinas-wonderlands/), âš do not do that!âš  use Defender's exceptions on security options in control panel and set the file/folders you don't want to scan. If you don't like using windows defender, pick another one but use an antivirus!.
