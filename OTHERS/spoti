Don't pay for it.

Spot-X removes annoyances from the service. The only thing you don't get is full quality which is 320kbps anyway and that's not lossless; you won't notice difference.

Spot-X will:
* remove ads
* remove musical ads (interruptions in your playlist)
* remove the next/last song changer limit.
* give you a better interface (optional)
* remove rather annoying recommendations set by where you live. (optional)
