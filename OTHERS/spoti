Don't pay for it.

Spot-X removes annoyances from the service. The only thing you don't get is full quality which is 320kbps anyway and that's not lossless; I swear you won't notice difference.
If you are in the path of being a "audiophile", then you shouldn't be looking at spotify, but rather deezer. In that case, use deemix with an ARL to get FLAC's instead of mp3's; 
but I encourage you to leave all that snake oil behind, flac files do sound better (crispy, less bass) but only at higher volume, but the size of the files are not worth it, unless of course 
you want to keep them lossless for a better reason like preservation.

Spot-X will:
* remove ads
* remove musical ads (interruptions in your playlist)
* remove the next/last song changer limit.
* give you a better interface (optional)
* remove rather annoying recommendations set by where you live. (optional)

As you can see, there is no reason to pay for that service. 



On a more idealistic side: Spotify is owning the music of the entire world. Yes I know they don't keep the rights of the music itself, but they own the MOST POPULAR platform,
meaning more and more artists abandoned other ways of publishing in favor of spotify; this means they have enourmous power and they can change the rules at any time. They are
sitting on top of 80% of the music of the world. Think of this; if one day spotify decides to pay 0,000000000000000000000000001 cents to the artist per playback but charge the 
user $100 per month, they can, and the artist will have no other choice if he/she wants to start a carreer and you will have no choice but to pay the $100.
This is called a monopoly.
Future will tell how wrong I am.
