DON'T BUY IT. üòÅ


Seriously, if you don't have a really good reason for doing so, like having kids that want it no matter what or you can't upgrade your PC to play emulators, DON'T BUY IT.
Why? here is a little list:

* Its a potato. Runs games at 30 fps most of the time.
* Ported games suck.
* Genuine games costs hilarious amounts of money for what you get.
* Childish/Low quality library of games. With exceptions known, Zelda and a couple more that may be childish, but still fun like Mario games. The other games are worse than a facebook game.
* Nintendo's empire. They are at war in the internet, I got a "nintendo enforcer" knocking at my digital doors once. Can't give more details for privacy sake, but believe me, they are patrolling.
* Yuzu plays very well on PC and mods can let you play at 60 FPS or/and better resolutions. It plays the AAA titles like the Zelda and Mario franchises.
* Its ridiculously expensive on some countries.
* Its just a trend that influencers keep alive. The console is a glorified cellphone with a low end nvidia chip on it.
